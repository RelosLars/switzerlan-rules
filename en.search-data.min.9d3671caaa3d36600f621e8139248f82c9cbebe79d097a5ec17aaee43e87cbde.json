The participants will play in self reffed lobbies. Upon entering the lobby the players must immediately send their match link to a tournament administrator.\nAll stages are FM. DT is exempt. All mods will be normalised in score.\nWarmups are NOT allowed during qualifiers as they hamper the points distribution. NF is enforced at all times.\nPer qualifier stage 2 cycles of each pool are granted. Each stage will have a submitting period ranging from 45 minutes to 70 and will be called out by an administrator.\nPlayers will collect points on each map totaling up to a maximum of 3 points per map.

Participants who lose a match continue playing in the losers bracket. Participants who lose a match in the losers bracket will be completely eliminated from the tournament.\nAfter both brackets have concluded, the winners of the two brackets compete in the grand finals.

This tournament will be fully self reffed until the Grand Finals.\nRoll and warmups (Brackets only) # At the beginning of a match, each player executes a !roll command.\nThe player with the highest roll points will have their warmup played first.
